# Hello! This is in progress

This is the repository that collects everything you need to begin editing levels in Min Hero!

So far, this was set up not long ago, and so everything might not be perfect.

But here's a rough guide anyway:

## Tools
First, it's recommended to have these installed:
* Inkscape (as the level editor)
* Python (to run encoder/decoder, and converter script)

## Process
Here is how it should work:
* Pick the room(s) that you want from the folder at [this link](https://github.com/square-nine/minhero-towerofsages-allfiles/tree/main/Source%20Files/decrypted_bins)
